“The _Schedule_ of Benefits: Physician Services is a _schedule_ under Regulation 552 of the _Health_
_Insurance Act_ with the exception of the Table of Contents, Appendices A, B, C, F, G, H, Q, and
the Numeric Index.”]


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**INTRODUCTION**


**[Commentary:**
The _Health Insurance Act_ and, to a lesser extent, the _Integrated Community Health Services_
_Centres Act, 2023_ and the _Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 2004_, provide the legal
foundation and framework for the _Schedule_ of Benefits for Physician Services (“the _Schedule_ ”).
The Schedule lists services insured by _OHIP_ and includes the General Preamble (which
impacts all physicians), Consultations and Visits section (which applies to all specialties) and
specific system and/or specialty sections (including specialty preambles).
The General Preamble provides details about billing requirements for all physicians as follows:
The initial **Definitions** **Section** **(GP2)** begins with general definitions of key terms and phrases
used in the Schedule. Those terms and phrases are italicized throughout the General Preamble
as an indication that further information is available in the Definitions Section. The second
group of defined terms refers specifically to maximums, minimums, and time or unit-based
services.
The information provided in the **General** **Information** **Section** **(GP8)** is the foundation for the
remainder of the General Preamble. A variety of subjects are reviewed as detailed in the table
of contents. This is followed by the **Constituent** **and** **Common** **Elements** **of** **Insured** **Services**
**(GP13)** . Next is the section which lists the **Specific** **Elements** **of** **Assessments** **(GP15)** . The
next section provides information on **Consultations** **and** **Assessments** **(GP16)** followed by
the section regarding services provided only in **Hospitals** **and** **Other** **Institutions** **(GP40)** .
The next section focuses on psychotherapy, counselling, and related services, followed by a
similar review of services that involve interviews. The remaining sections include special visits,
surgical assistants’ services, anaesthesiologists’ services, and others as listed in the table of
contents.]

**GP6** **February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**DEFINITIONS**

**MAXIMUMS,** **MINIMUMS** **AND** **TIME** **OR UNIT-BASED** **SERVICES**
In this Schedule when the amount payable for a service is described:

**a.** In terms of a maximum number of services without reference to a specific time period to
which the maximum applies, this means that the maximum refers to a maximum number of
services per patient per day. Those services rendered to the same patient on the same day
in excess of the maximum for that patient on that day are _not eligible for payment_ .

**b.** In terms of a maximum number of services with reference to a specific time period to which
the maximum applies, the services are calculated per patient and the number of services is
based upon services rendered chronologically. Those services rendered to the same patient
during that specific time period in excess of the maximum for that patient are _not eligible for_
_payment_ .

**c.** In terms of a maximum with reference to a specific part of the anatomy, this means a
maximum number of services per patient per day. Those services rendered in excess of the
maximum for that specific part of the anatomy per patient on that day are _not eligible for_
_payment_ .

**d.** In terms of a minimum number of services without reference to a specific time period to
which the minimum applies, this means that the minimum refers to a minimum number of
services per patient per day. With the exception of those services listed in the “Diagnostic
Radiology” section of the Schedule or unless specifically stated otherwise, where less than
the number of services required to satisfy the minimum are rendered, the services are _not_
_eligible for payment_ .

same physician on the same day.

**f.** In terms of a minimum required duration of time, the physician must record on the patient’s
permanent medical record or chart the time when the insured service started and ended. If
the patient’s permanent medical record or chart does not include this required information,
the service is _not eligible for payment_ .

**g.** Based upon the number of “units” of service rendered, the physician must record on the
patient’s permanent medical record or chart the time when the insured service started and
ended. If the patient’s permanent medical record or chart does not include this required
information, the service is _not eligible for payment_ .


**February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)** **GP7**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**GENERAL** **INFORMATION**

**[Commentary:** **Services** **Insured** **by** **OHIP**
The Schedule is established under section 37.1 of regulation 552 under the Act. The fees listed
are the amounts payable by _OHIP_ for insured services. Insured services under the Act are
limited to those which are listed in this Schedule, medically necessary, are not otherwise
excluded by legislation or regulation, and are rendered personally by physicians or by others
delegated to perform them where such delegation is authorized in accordance with the
Schedule requirements for delegated services.
Some services are specifically listed as uninsured in regulation 552, section 24 of the Act (see
Appendix A), such as a service that is solely for the purpose of altering or restoring
appearance. Other services may be uninsured depending on the circumstances. An example
of a service which is uninsured in limited circumstances is psychotherapy, which is uninsured
where it is a requirement for the patient to obtain a diploma or degree or to fulfill a course of
study. Other examples of commonly _uninsured service_ s include missed appointments or
procedures, circumcision except if medically necessary, and certain services rendered and
documents and forms completed in connection with non-medically necessary requests (e.g. life
insurance application).]

**[Commentary:** **Modifications** **to** **the** **Schedule**
Under agreement between the _MOH_ and the _OMA_, additions, deletions, fee changes, or other
modifications to the Schedule, are made by the _MOH_ following consultation and/or negotiation
with the _OMA_ . Physicians who wish to have modifications to the Schedule considered should
submit any proposals to the Physician Payment Committee (PPC) through the appropriate
clinical section of the _OMA_ .
In the situation where a new therapy or procedure is being introduced into Ontario, and the
physicians performing the new therapy or procedure wish to have a new fee item inserted into
the Schedule, the following process is recommended.
An application for a new fee related to the new therapy or procedure should be submitted by
the appropriate section(s) of the _OMA_ to the PPC for consideration, with documentation
supporting the introduction of this item into the Schedule. The PPC will advise _OHIP_ whether or
not this new therapy is experimental. If the PPC and the _MOH_ agree that the item is
experimental, the service is deemed uninsured (in accordance with section 24 of regulation
552 under the Act), and will not be introduced into the Schedule. If the _MOH_, on the advice of
the PPC, determines that the new therapy or procedure is not experimental, the fee application
will be handled in the usual manner as detailed above.]

**[Commentary:** **Medical** **Research**
Examinations or procedures for the purpose of a research or survey program are not insured
services, nor are services provided by a laboratory or a hospital that support an examination or
procedure that is for the purpose of research or a survey. The exception to this is that an
assessment conducted to determine if an insured person is suitable for such a program is not
necessarily an _uninsured service_ (see section 24 of regulation 552 under the Act - this is
provided as Appendix A of the Schedule).]

**[Commentary:** **Medical** **Records**
All insured services must be documented in appropriate records. The Act requires that the
record establish that:
**1.** an insured service was provided;
**2.** the service for which the account is submitted is the service that was rendered; and
**3.** the service was medically necessary.
The medical record requirements as found in the Act are listed in Appendix G of the Schedule.]


**GP8** **February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**GENERAL** **INFORMATION**

**GENERAL** **PAYMENT** **RULES**

**[Commentary:**
Claims for payment must be submitted to _OHIP_ in the form and by the medium (e.g. electronic
data transmission; machine readable input) as set out in sections 38.3 to 38.5 of regulation 552
under the Act and must contain the information required by the regulation and the General
Manager of _OHIP_ . Regulation 552 under the Act can be found at:
[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Regs/English/900552_e.htm.](http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Regs/English/900552_e.htm)
Claims must be submitted within three _month_ s of the date the service was rendered, except in
extenuating circumstances. A claim cannot be accepted for payment unless it meets all of the
technical and formal requirements set out in the Act and regulations.]

**1.** The fee is payable only to the physician who rendered the service personally, or by the
physician whose delegate rendered the service where delegation is authorized in accordance
with the Schedule.

**2.** Where more than one physician renders different components of a listed service, only one fee is
payable for that service, and the fee is payable only where the Schedule provides that different
physicians may perform different components of the service.

**[Commentary:**
Where an insured service contains several components (e.g. surgical procedures that include
post-operative care or fracture care), the components of the service are not divisible among
physicians for claims purposes and the physicians are responsible for apportioning payment
amongst themselves.]

**3.** Where the Schedule provides that different physicians may substitute for one another in
performing the total service, only one fee is payable for the service.

**[Commentary:**
When physicians routinely or frequently substitute for each other in providing hospital visits to
registered bed patients in active treatment hospitals, e.g. _week_ end coverage or daily rounds by
various members of a group, the _most responsible physician_ may claim for all the visits.]

**Specialist** **services**
When a service rendered by a _specialist_ comprises part of an insured consultation or assessment that
falls within the scope of his or her _specialist_ practice, the service is _not eligible for payment_ unless the
claim for the service is submitted either:

**a.** unless otherwise noted, in respect of a service described in the portions of the Consultations
and Visits section of this Schedule that reflects the physician’s Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Canada specialty, as documented in the records maintained by the _MOH_
for claims payment purposes; or

**b.** in respect of a service described in this Schedule under the following sub-headings which
can be claimed by any specialty: psychotherapy, counselling, HIV primary care, _palliative_
_care_ support, hypnotherapy, certification of mental illness, interviews, genetic assessments,
midwife or aboriginal midwife-requested emergency and special emergency assessments,
_home_ care application, or _home_ care supervision.


**February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)** **GP9**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**
**GENERAL** **INFORMATION**
When a service rendered by a _specialist_ does not fall within the scope of the _specialist_ ’s practice and/
or the _specialist_ is providing primary care in a family or general practice setting, the service is _only_
_eligible for payment_ when the claim is submitted using the appropriate code from the “Family Practice
& Practice in General” listings.

When more than one assessment is rendered to a patient during the same visit by the same physician
who is qualified in one or more specialties, only one assessment is payable.

**[Commentary:**
Any additional assessment is _not eligible for payment_ .]

**Use** **of** **Codes,** **Prefixes** **and** **Suffixes**

**[Commentary:**
Services are generally, but not necessarily, listed by anatomical system or specialty for
convenience.]
The alpha-numeric fee code opposite the service listing in this Schedule must be set out in the claim
submitted, together with the required suffix.


Surgical Codes: In the surgical part of the Schedule, the required suffixes are:

suffix A if the physician performs the procedure;

suffix B if the physician assisted at the surgery; and

suffix C if the physician administered the anaesthetic.

**2.** attends a hospital where he or she receives an insured diagnostic service; and

**3.** within 24 hours of receiving that diagnostic service, is admitted to the same hospital as an inpatient in connection with the same condition, illness, injury or disease in relation to which the
diagnostic service was rendered.


**[Commentary:**
**1.** For those diagnostic services which have both technical and _professional component_ s listed
under one fee schedule code, the technical and _professional component_ s are claimed
separately. The claim for the _technical component_ is submitted using the fee schedule code
with the suffix B and the claim for the _professional component_ is submitted using the fee
schedule code with a suffix C.
**2.** The _technical component_ may be listed as either " _technical component_ " or in a column

**GENERAL** **INFORMATION**

**2.** For delegated services rendered in the physician’s office, see the Delegated Procedures
section in the General Preamble of this Schedule.]

**Consultation** **and** **Assessment** **Codes**
There are four different prefixes used for consultations and assessments listed in the “Consultations
and Visits” section of the Schedule. The codes with the “A” prefix are described as the “General
Listings”. These must be used when submitting a claim for consultations and assessments except in
the following situations when the code listed below must be used:

**1.** acute care hospital – non-emergency in-patient services – “C” prefix codes;

**2.** long term care institution – non-emergency in-patient services – “W” prefix codes;

**3.** emergency department – services rendered by a physician on duty – “H” prefix (H1- codes); or

**4.** rehabilitation unit – services rendered by a _**specialist**_ in Physical Medicine – “H” prefix codes
(H3XX codes)

with a special visit premium. Information regarding when special visit premiums are payable is
found on pages GP65 to GP78 of the General Preamble.]


**Independent** **Consideration** **(IC)**
Services listed in the Schedule without specified fees are identified as “IC” and are given independent
consideration by the _medical consultant_ . Claims for such services must be submitted with a
supporting letter explaining the amount of the fee claimed, and must include an appropriate operative
or consultation report, and a comparison of the scope and difficulty of the procedure in relation to nonIC procedures in the Schedule. For treatment of tumours not listed in the Schedule, surgeons must
use the IC code, R993, and for surgical procedures not listed, but similar to a listed service, the code,
R990.


**GP12** **February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**CONSTITUENT** **AND** **COMMON** **ELEMENTS** **OF** **INSURED** **SERVICES**

**[Commentary:**
This Schedule identifies the _constituent elements_ that comprise insured services. _Common_
_elements_ apply to all insured services and _specific elements_ apply to specific groups of
services where identified either in the General Preamble or in the preamble to a specific
system and/or specialty sections of the Schedule. There may be additional specific
requirements (“required elements of service”, “payment rules”, “claims submission instructions”
or “notes”) for some individual services, and these are noted with the description of any such
service within the Schedule. In order to determine the correct claim to use for a service
rendered, the necessary information is found by reviewing the _common elements_, _specific_
_elements_, and service specific information.
No charges may be made (except to _OHIP_ ) for an insured service rendered to an insured
person or for any of the _constituent elements_ of such insured services. This is prohibited by the
Act and/or the _Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 2004_ .
Most services include as a constituent element of the service the provision of the premises,
equipment, supplies, and personnel used in the performance of the common and _specific_
_elements_ of the service. This is not, however, the case for services denoted by codes marked
with the prefix “#”, and for services that are divided into _professional and technical component_ s

**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**CONSULTATIONS**

**CONSULTATION**

**Definition/Required** **elements** **of** **service:**
A consultation is an assessment rendered following a written request from a referring:

**1.** physician

**2.** _nurse practitioner_ or

**3.** _dental surgeon_ in connection with an insured dental procedure rendered in a hospital,

who, in light of his/her professional knowledge of the patient, requests the opinion of a physician (the
“consultant physician”) competent to give advice in this field because of the complexity, seriousness,
or obscurity of the case, or because another opinion is requested by the patient or _patient’s_
_representative_ .

**[Commentary:**
**1.** The referring physician, _nurse practitioner_ or _dental surgeon_ must determine if multiple
requests by a patient or the _patient’s representative_ to different physicians in the same
specialty for the same condition are medically necessary. Services that are not medically
necessary are uninsured.
**2.** If the physician rendering the service requests a referring physician, _nurse practitioner_ or
_dental surgeon_ to submit a consultation request for that service after the service has been
provided, a consultation is not payable. The visit fee appropriate to the service rendered may
be claimed.
**3.** Where a physician who has been paid for a consultation for the patient for the same
diagnosis makes a request for a referral for ongoing management of the patient, the service
rendered following the referral is not payable as a consultation, except as outlined in the
Virtual Care Services section under definitions, part 3, commentary 3]
A consultation includes the services necessary to enable the consultant to prepare a written report
(including findings, opinions, and recommendations) to the referring physician, _nurse practitioner_ or
_dental surgeon._ Where the _referral_ is made by a _nurse practitioner,_ the consultant shall provide the
report to the _nurse practitioner_ and the patient’s primary care provider, if applicable. Except where
otherwise specified, the consultant is required to perform a general, specific or medical specific
assessment, including a review of all relevant data.

The following are additional requirements for a consultation:

**a.** A copy of the written request for the consultation, signed by the referring physician, _nurse_
_practitioner_ or _dental surgeon_ must be kept in the consulting physician’s medical record,
except in the case of a consultation which occurs in a hospital, long-term care institution or
multi-specialty clinic where common medical records are maintained. In such cases, the
written request may be contained on the common medical record.

**b.** The request identifies the consultant by name, the referring physician, _nurse practitioner_ or
_dental surgeon_ by name and billing number, and identifies the patient by name and health
number.

**c.** The written request sets out the information relevant to the _referral_ and specifies the
service(s) required.

In the event these requirements are not met, the amount payable for a consultation will be reduced to
a lesser assessment fee.


**GP16** **February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**
**CONSULTATIONS**

**[Commentary:**
The request would ordinarily also include appropriate clinical information, such as the reason
for the _referral_ for consultation, present and past history, physical findings and relevant test
results and reports.]

**Payment** **rules:**

**1.** Consultations rendered to the same patient by the same physician for the same diagnosis are
limited to one service per two consecutive _12 month periods_ except:

**a.** When the additional consultation service(s) is a repeat consultation;

**b.** When a consultant has rendered a consultation service to a patient in any location and the
same consultant is referred to the same patient a second time with the same diagnosis, then
the number of consultations eligible for payment is a total of two services per two
consecutive _12 month periods_ only when:

**i.** the second consultation is rendered for a hospital inpatient or a patient in an Emergency
Department; and

**ii.** the consultation is rendered more than 12 _months_ but less than 24 _months_ following the
first consultation.

See the Table below.

specific assessment, depending upon the specialty of the consultant where:


**February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)** **GP17**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**CONSULTATIONS**

**a.** consultations are in excess of the above limits;

**b.** the payment requirements of a repeat consultation are not met; or

**c.** the consultation is requested by a Medical Trainee.

**Note:**
**1.** The above limits are applicable to all consultations, including time-based and age-specific

repeat consultations.
**2.** In the preoperative preparation of a patient undergoing the following low risk elective surgical
procedures under local anaesthesia and/or I.V. sedation, a preoperative consultation by any
physician is _only eligible for payment_ where the medical record demonstrates the
consultation is medically necessary.

**a.** cataract surgery;
**b.** colonoscopy;
**c.** cystoscopy;
**d.** carpal tunnel surgery; or

**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**CONSULTATIONS**

**REPEAT** **CONSULTATION**

**Definition/Required** **elements** **of** **service:**
A repeat consultation is an additional consultation rendered by the same consultant, in respect of the
same presenting problem, following care rendered to the patient by another physician in the interval
following the initial consultation but preceding the repeat consultation.

A repeat consultation has the same requirements as a consultation including the requirement for a
new written request by the referring physician, _nurse practitioner_ or _dental surgeon._


**LIMITED** **CONSULTATION**

**Definition/Required** **elements** **of** **service:**
A limited consultation is a consultation which is less demanding and, in terms of time, normally
requires substantially less of the physician’s time than the full consultation. Otherwise, a limited
consultation has the same requirements as a full consultation.

Under the heading of “Family Practice & Practice in General", a limited consultation is the service
rendered by any physician who is not a _specialist_, where the service meets all the requirements for a
consultation but, because of the nature of the _referral_, only those services which constitute a specific
assessment are rendered.


**EMERGENCY** **ROOM** **(ER)** **PHYSICIAN** **CONSULTATION**
**Payment** **rules:**

**1.** The amount payable for a consultation by an ER Physician will be adjusted to a lesser
assessment fee under either of the following circumstances:

**a.** the patient is referred by another ER physician in the same hospital; or

**b.** the service is rendered in any location other than the emergency department or other critical
care area in a hospital, or to a critically ill patient in a hospital.

**2.** ER reports constitute adequate documentation of the written report of the consultation as long
as the rendering of all _constituent elements_ is clearly documented on all copies of the report. If
the consulting physician fails to ensure that a copy of the ER report is sent to the physician or
_nurse practitioner_ who referred the patient, the amount payable for the service will be adjusted
to the amount payable for an assessment.


**Claims** **submission** **instruction:**
Claims for ER Physician consultations are to be submitted using H055 for a _specialist_ in emergency
medicine (FRCP) and H065 for all other physicians.


**SPECIAL** **SURGICAL** **CONSULTATION**

**Definition/Required** **elements** **of** **service:**
A special surgical consultation is rendered when a surgeon provides all the appropriate elements of a
regular consultation and is required to devote at least fifty minutes exclusively to the consultation with
the patient.

**[Commentary:**
The calculation of the 50 minute minimum excludes time devoted to any other service or
procedure for which an amount is payable in addition to the consultation.]

**1.** _Newborn_ care is limited to a maximum of one per patient except when a well baby is transferred
to another hospital in which case the fee for _newborn_ care may be payable to a physician at
both hospitals.

**[Commentary:**
An example where this is possible is if the transfer occurred because of the state of health of
the mother.]
**2.** Despite the requirement that to be eligible for a special visit premium the call be non-elective
(see GP65), a special visit premium is payable in addition to this service if a physician is
required to make an additional visit to the hospital outside of his or her normally scheduled

for well baby care, an 18 _month_ age-appropriate developmental screen and concerns identified
from the review of the brief standardized tool with the parent/guardian, legal representative or
other caregiver are recorded in the patient’s permanent medical record.

**[Commentary:**
An example of an 18 _month_ age-appropriate developmental screen would be that outlined in
the Rourke Baby Record and an example of a brief standardized tool completed by the parent/
guardian, legal representative or other caregiver that aids the identification of _child_ ren at risk of
a developmental disorder would be the Nipissing District Developmental Screen or similar

**E-Assessments**

**Definition/Required** **elements** **of** **service:**
An e-assessment is a service performed by a _specialist_ when a primary care physician or _nurse_
_practitioner_ requests an opinion and/or recommendations from the _specialist_ for management of a
specific patient by providing information electronically through a secure server (e.g. secure
messaging, EMR). The _specialist_ is required to review all relevant data provided by the primary care
physician or _nurse practitioner,_ including the review of any additional information that may be
submitted subsequent to the initial request. For the purpose of this service, “relevant data” _may_
_include_ family/patient history, history of the presenting complaint, laboratory and diagnostic tests, and
visual images where indicated.

In addition to the _Common Elements_, E-assessments include the _specific elements_ of assessments,
as listed in the General Preamble, except for paragraphs A and B.

**Payment** **rules:**
**1.** E-assessments are _only eligible for payment_ if the _specialist_ has provided an opinion and/or
recommendations for patient management to the primary care physician or _nurse practitioner_
within 30 days from the date of the request. Where a service is requested by a _nurse_
_practitioner_ the consultant shall provide the report to the _nurse practitioner_ and the patient’s
primary care provider, if applicable.

**2.** E-assessments are _not eligible for payment_ to the _specialist_ in the following circumstances

**a.** when the purpose of the electronic communication is to arrange for transfer of the
patient’s care to any physician; or
**b.** when rendered in whole or in part to arrange for a consultation, a different assessment,
visit, or K-prefix time-based services, procedure(s), or diagnostic investigation(s); or
**c.** when the _specialist_ renders a K-prefix time-based service for the same patient within 30
days following the request for the _specialist_ e-assessment; or
**d.** in circumstances where the primary care physician or _specialist_ receives compensation,
other than by fee-for service under this Schedule, for participation in the e-assessment.
**3.** A consultation, a different assessment or visit rendered by the _specialist_ for the same patient
for the same diagnosis within 60 days following the request for the _specialist_ e-assessment is
only payable as a specific or partial assessment, as appropriate to the service rendered.
**4.** K738 is eligible for payment to the primary care physician when this physician is required to
collect additional data (for example dermatology or ophthalmology images not present in the
primary care physician’s records) to support the _specialist_ ’s e-assessment. K738 is _not_
_eligible for payment_ where existing data is already available in the primary care physician’s
records for submission to the _specialist_ .

**[Commentary:**
**1.** Following the primary care physician’s request, the _specialist_ decides whether an eassessment is the most appropriate service in the circumstances. In some cases, direct
patient contact or a consultation by videoconference may be more appropriate.
**2.** Payment, other than by fee-for-service, includes compensation where the physician receives
remuneration under a salary, primary care, stipend, APP or AFP model.
**3.** Physicians who receive compensation other than by fee-for-service under this Schedule
should consult their contract for guidance on shadow-billing.]

_specialist_ must review all relevant data provided by the primary care physician and provide a written
opinion that includes a diagnosis and/or management advice to the primary care physician or _nurse_
_practitioner_ .

**[Commentary:**
The time and intensity of this service is the same as a regular consultation. The _specialist_ may
choose to return their opinion by phone, however, a written opinion must be provided
electronically or by mail.]

**Payment** **rules:**
Initial e-assessments are limited to a maximum of one per patient per _specialist_ per _12 month_
_period_ unless the primary care physician or _nurse practitioner_ makes a second request in
relation to a complaint for which a clearly different diagnosis is made, unrelated to the
diagnosis made at the time of the first e-assessment in that same _12 month period_, in which
case the limit is increased to a maximum of two per patient per _specialist_ per _12 month period_ .

**[Commentary:**
If a subsequent e-assessment is related to the diagnosis made at the time of the initial eassessment, then this service is payable as a repeat e-assessment, follow-up e-assessment or
minor e-assessment as appropriate to the service rendered.]


**repeat** **E-ASSESSMENT**

**Definition/** **Required** **elements** **of** **service:**
Repeat e-assessment is the first e-assessment performed by a particular _specialist_ following an initial

_nurse practitioner_ for the same diagnosis where the _specialist_ must review all relevant data provided
by the primary care physician or _nurse practitioner_ and provide an opinion that includes management
advice to the primary care physician or _nurse practitioner_ .

**[Commentary:**
The time and intensity of this service is the same as a specific assessment. The _specialist_ may
choose to return their opinion by phone.]

**Payment** **rules:**
Repeat e-assessments are limited to a maximum of one per patient per physician per _12 month_
_period_ unless the primary care physician or _nurse practitioner_ makes a second request in
relation to a complaint for which a clearly different diagnosis is made, unrelated to the
diagnosis made at the time of the first e- assessment in that same _12 month period_, in which
case the limit is increased to a maximum of two per patient per physician per _12 month period_ .

has previously rendered any insured service to the patient for the same diagnosis. The _specialist_ must
review all relevant information submitted and provide an opinion and/or management advice to the
primary care physician or _nurse practitioner_ .

A minor e-assessment is a brief e-assessment rendered by the _specialist_ . The _specialist_ must review
all relevant information submitted and provide an answer to the primary care physician’s or _nurse_
_practitioner’s_ specific clinical question.

**Payment** **rules:**
Minor e-assessment is limited to a maximum of:

**1.** one (1) service per patient per day, same physician;
**2.** twelve (12) services per patient same physician per _12 month period_ ; and
**3.** two thousand (2000) services per physician per _12 month period_ .

**[Commentary:**
A minor e-assessment is where the primary care physician or _nurse practitioner_ may ask a
specific question related to the patient where the information provided is limited and the
question asked is very specific. An example is where the primary care physician has initiated a
treatment recommended by the _specialist_, and the primary care physician requests a brief
email response related to proper dosing adjustments. One service _may include_ multiple emails.
The _specialist_ may choose to return their opinion by phone.]

**A.** **Admission** **Assessment** **–** **General** **Requirements**


**Definition:**

**a.** An admission assessment is the initial assessment of the patient rendered for the purpose
of admitting a patient to hospital.

**b.** The admitting physician is the physician who renders the admission assessment.


**Payment** **rules:**

**1.** Except as outlined below in paragraph 3, when the admitting physician has not previously
assessed the patient for the same presenting illness within 90 days of the admission
assessment, the admission assessment constitutes a consultation, general or medical specific
or specific assessment depending on the specialty of the physician, the nature of the service
rendered and any applicable payment rules.

**2.** Except as outlined below in paragraph 3, if the admitting physician has previously assessed the
patient for the same presenting illness within 90 days of the admission assessment, the
admission assessment constitutes a general re-assessment or specific re-assessment
depending on the specialty of the physician, the nature of the service rendered and any
applicable payment rules.

**3.** When a hospital in-patient is transferred from one physician to another physician, only one
consultation, general or specific assessment or reassessment is eligible for payment
per patient admission. The amount eligible for payment for services in excess of this limit will be
adjusted to a lesser assessment fee. An additional admission assessment is _not eligible for_
_payment_ when a hospital inpatient is transferred from one physician to another physician within
the same hospital.


**Admission** **Assessments** **by** **Specialists:**
When a patient has been assessed by a _specialist_ in the emergency room (ER) or out-patient
department (OPD) and that physician renders a service described as a consultation, specific
assessment, or medical specific assessment and subsequently admits the patient to hospital, the
initial consultation, specific, or medical specific assessment constitutes the admission assessment.

When a patient has been assessed by a _specialist_ in the ER or OPD, and that physician renders any
other assessment other than those listed in the paragraph immediately above, and that physician
subsequently admits the patient to hospital, an admission assessment is eligible for payment in
addition to the initial assessment, if each service is rendered separately.

**[Commentary:**
In accordance with the surgical preamble, a hospital admission assessment by the surgeon is
_not eligible for payment_, unless it is the “major pre-operative visit” (i.e., the consultation or
assessment which may be claimed when the decision to operate is made and the operation is
scheduled).]

When a patient has been assessed by a general or family practitioner in the emergency room (ER) or
out-patient department (OPD) and that physician renders a service described as a consultation,
general assessment, or general re-assessment and subsequently admits the patient to hospital, the
initial consultation, general assessment, general re-assessment constitutes the admission
assessment.

When a patient has been assessed by a general or family practitioner in the ER or OPD and that
physician renders any other assessment other than those listed in the paragraph immediately above,
and subsequently admits the patient to hospital, an admission assessment is eligible for payment in
addition to the initial assessment, if each assessment is rendered separately.


**Payment** **rules:**
A933/C933/C003/C004 are _not eligible for payment_ for an admission assessment for an elective
surgery patient when a pre-operative assessment has been rendered to the same patient within 30
days of admission by the same physician.

When a patient has been assessed by an emergency physician in the ER or OPD and that physician
renders a service described as a consultation, general assessment, or general re-assessment and
subsequently admits the patient to hospital as the _most responsible physician_ or that physician is
asked to perform the admission assessment (even though the patient is admitted under a different
_most responsible physician_ ), the initial consultation, general assessment, or general re-assessment
constitutes the admission assessment.

When a patient has been assessed by an emergency physician in the ER or OPD and that physician
renders any other assessment other than those listed in the paragraph immediately above, and
subsequently renders the admission assessment, (even if the patient is admitted under a different
_most responsible physician_ ), the admission assessment is payable as C004, in addition to the initial
assessment, if both services are rendered separately.

**2.** E082 is _only eligible for payment_ :

**a.** if the physician establishes that he or she does not receive any direct or indirect
remuneration from a hospital or hospital foundation for rendering in-patient clinical
services; or
**b.** where the physician receives any direct or indirect remuneration from a hospital or
hospital foundation for rendering in-patient clinical services, if the physician establishes
that such remuneration has been reduced by an amount equal to the amount that would
be eligible for payment to the physician had he or she not received any such direct or
indirect remuneration.

**3.** E082 is _not eligible for payment_ for transfers within the same hospital.
**4.** E082 is not applicable to any other service or premium.

**[Commentary:**

not render the admission assessment, E082 is _not eligible for payment_ for any service
rendered by any physician during that hospital admission.
**2.** E082 is _not eligible for payment_ for a patient admitted for obstetrical delivery or for a
_newborn_ .
**3.** E082 is not applicable for any consultation or assessment related to day surgery.]

**B.** **Subsequent** **Visit**


**Definition:**
A subsequent visit is any routine assessment in hospital following the hospital admission assessment.

**Attendance** **at** **Surgery:** If, in the interest of the patient, the referring physician is asked to be
present by the patient or the _patient’s representative_, but does not assist at the procedure, the
attendance at surgery by the referring physician constitutes a hospital subsequent visit.

**Multidisciplinary** **care:** Except where a single service for a team of physicians is listed in this
Schedule (e.g. the _week_ ly team fee for dialysis), when the complexity of the medical condition
requires the services of several physicians in different disciplines, each physician visit
constitutes a subsequent visit.

**Payment** **rules:**

**1.** Except in the circumstances outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3, or when a patient is referred from
one physician to another (see Claims submission instruction below), subsequent visits are
limited to one per patient, per day for the first 5 _week_ s after admission, 3 visits per _week_ from 6
to 13 _week_ s after admission, and 6 visits per _month_ after 13 _week_ s. Services in excess of the
limit are _not eligible for payment_ .

**2.** After 5 _week_ s of hospitalization, any assessment in hospital required as a result of an acute
intercurrent illness in excess of the _week_ ly or _month_ ly limits set out above constitutes C121 –
“additional visit due to intercurrent illness”. The _week_ ly or _month_ ly limits set out above do not
apply to additional visits due to intercurrent illness.

**3.** Pediatric subsequent visits (C262) are limited to one per patient, per day for the duration of the
admission.

**4.** When a physician is already in the hospital and assesses one of his/her own patients or patients
transferred to his/her care, the service constitutes a subsequent visit. If a physician assesses
another physician’s patient on an emergency basis, the General Listings (“A” prefix) apply.


**Claims** **submission** **instruction:**
When a hospital in-patient is referred from one physician to another physician, the date the second
physician assessed the patient for the first time is considered the “admission date” for the purposes of
determining the appropriate subsequent visit fee code.

**[Commentary:**
When a hospital in-patient is transferred from one physician to another physician, subsequent
visits by the second physician are calculated based on the actual admission date of the
patient.]

the physician identified as the patient’s _MRP_ for rendering a subsequent visit on this day.


**Payment** **rules:**

**1.** C122, C123 are limited to a maximum of one each per hospital admission.

**[Commentary:**
C122, C123 are only payable for visits rendered by the _MRP_ . Services rendered by physicians
who are not the _MRP_ may be payable at a lesser visit fee.]
**2.** C122, C123 are _not eligible for payment_ :

**a.** when rendered to the same patient the same day as C124 (Subsequent visit by the _MRP_    day of discharge);

**b.** for a patient admitted for obstetrical delivery or _newborn_ care; or

**c.** for any visit rendered by a surgeon during the 2 days prior to non-Z prefix surgery.

**3.** C122, C123 are not payable for a subsequent visit rendered by a surgeon to a hospital inpatient following non-Z prefix surgery.

**[Commentary:**
The first and second post-operative visits by the surgeon to a hospital in-patient following nonZ prefix surgery constitute post-operative visits payable at the appropriate specialty specific
subsequent visit fee.]

**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**SPECIAL** **VISIT** **PREMIUMS**

**SPECIAL** **VISIT** **PREMIUMS**
Special visit means a visit initiated by a patient or an individual on behalf of the patient for the purpose
of rendering a non-elective service or, if rendered in the patient's _home_, a non-elective or elective
service.


A special visit premium is payable in respect of a special visit rendered to an insured person, subject
to the conditions and limitations set out below. All special visit premiums are subject to the maximums,
limitations and conditions set out in the "Special Visit Premium Table" applicable in the circumstances.

**Payment** **rules:**

**1.** Special visit premiums are _only eligible for payment_ when rendered with certain services
listed under "Consultations and Visits" and "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures"
sections of this Schedule.
**2.** Regardless of the time of day at which the service is rendered, special visit premiums are _not_
_eligible for payment_ in the following circumstances:

**a.** for patients seen during rounds at a hospital or long-term care institution (including a
nursing _home_ or _home_ for the aged);
**b.** in conjunction with admission assessments of patients who have been admitted to
hospital on an elective basis;
**c.** for non-referred or transferred obstetrical patients except, in the case of transferred
obstetrical patients for a special visit for obstetrical delivery with sacrifice of office hours
for the first patient seen (C989);
**d.** for services rendered in a place, other than a hospital or long-term care facility, that is
scheduled to be open for the purpose of diagnosing or treating patients;
**e.** for a visit for which critical care team fees are payable under this Schedule;
**f.** in conjunction with any sleep study service listed in the sleep studies section of this
Schedule; or
**g.** for services rendered to patients who present to an office without an appointment while
the physician is there, or for patients seen immediately before, during or immediately after
routine or ordinary office hours even if held at night or on _week_ ends or _holiday_ s.

**3.** Special visit premiums are _not eligible for payment_ with services described by emergency
department "H" prefix fee codes.

**[Commentary:**
For elective _home_ visits rendered during daytime, evenings, nights or _week_ ends, submit
claim(s) using fee codes found under the column titled "Elective _Home_ Visit" of Special Visit
Premium Table VI listed on page GP75.]

Sacrifice of office hours means an insured service rendered when the demands of the patient and/or
the patient's condition are such that the physician makes a previously unscheduled non-elective visit
to the patient at a time when the physician had an office visit booked with one or more patients but,
because of the previously unscheduled non-elective visit, any such office visit was delayed or
cancelled.


**February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)** **GP65**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**SPECIAL** **VISIT** **PREMIUMS**

**PREMIUMS**

**[Commentary:**
Special visit premiums are in respect of either or both: a "travel premium" and a "patient seen"
premium (i.e. "first person seen premium" or "an additional person seen premium").]

**A.** Travel Premium


**Definition/required** **elements** **of** **service:**
A travel premium is _only eligible for payment_ for travel from one location to another location ("the
destination") subject to the payment rules below.

A travel premium is _not eligible for payment_ when a physician is required to travel from one location to
another within the same long-term care facility, hospital complex or within buildings situated on the
same hospital campus.

**[Commentary:**
**1.** A first person seen premium may be eligible for payment in this circumstance.
**2.** Only one travel premium is eligible for payment for each separate trip to a destination
regardless of the number of patients seen in association with each trip.]

**B.** First person seen premium

A first person seen premium is eligible for payment for the first person seen at the destination under
one of the following circumstances ("the eligible times"):

**1.** if the insured service is commenced evenings (17:00 hr-24:00 hr) Monday to Friday; daytime or
evenings on Saturdays, Sundays, and _Holiday_ s; or nights (24:00 hr-07:00 hr);

**2.** if rendered requiring sacrifice of office hours; or

**3.** if rendered during daytime hours (07:00 - 17:00 hrs Monday through Friday) in circumstances in
which a travel premium is eligible for payment.


**C.** Additional person premium

An additional person premium is _only eligible for payment_ for services rendered at the destination to
additional patients seen in emergency departments, outpatient departments, long-term care
institutions or to hospital inpatients, provided that each additional patient service is commenced
during the eligible times.

**[Commentary:**
Special visit premiums are _not eligible for payment_ for elective services rendered at a long-term
care institution, including a nursing _home_ or _home_ for the aged, even when the long-term care
institution is the " _home_ " of the patient.
Submit claims for routine elective visits in these locations as subsequent visits. For example, if
the physician is called to a nursing _home_ to see a patient for a non-elective problem at 8AM,
and subsequently sees his/her routine patients on rounds, those additional patients do not
qualify for the additional person premium.]


**GP66** **February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**SPECIAL** **VISIT** **PREMIUMS**

**LIMITS** **FOR** **SPECIAL** **VISIT** **PREMIUMS**
Special visit premiums in excess of the maximums listed in the Special Visit Premium Tables are _not_
_eligible for payment_ .


The maximums apply to the number of patients where special visit premiums may be eligible for
payment on that service date or in the time period specified.


**LIMITS** **FOR** **GERIATRIC** **HOME** **VISIT** **SPECIAL** **VISIT** **PREMIUMS**
For the purpose of special visit premiums under the heading "Geriatric _Home_ Visit Special Visit
Premiums", the special visit premiums listed under Table X are _only eligible for payment_ to:

**a.** a _specialist_ in Geriatrics (07); or

**b.** a physician with an exemption to access bonus impact in Care of the Elderly from the _MOH_ .


**LIMITS** **FOR** **EMERGENCY** **DEPARTMENT** **PHYSICIAN**
For the purpose of special visit premiums under the heading "Emergency Department Physician",
"Emergency Department Physician" means a physician:

**a.** who on a day when the physician is scheduled to work in a hospital emergency department
specifically for the purpose of rendering services to patients who attend the emergency
department for physician services,

**i.** is requested by the emergency department to attend at a time when the physician is not
otherwise scheduled to work in the emergency department; and

**ii.** who is not at the hospital at the time the emergency department request for attendance
is made; or

**b.** is on-call on a scheduled basis specifically to be available to a hospital emergency
department to render services to patients who attend the emergency department for
physician services and who is not at the hospital at the time the emergency department
request for attendance is made.

**[Commentary:**
Emergency room physicians may be primarily funded either through an Emergency
Department Alternate Funding Arrangement (ED-AFA) or fee-for-service.]

In addition to the general restrictions regarding special visits as outlined above, there are specific
restrictions which apply to special visit premiums for services rendered in the emergency department
by Emergency Department Physicians (as defined above). These limits are listed in the Special Visit
Premiums table under the heading “Emergency Department by Emergency Department Physician”
(Table V). Special Visit Premiums listed in the Special Visit Premiums table under the heading
"Emergency Department" (Table I) are _not eligible for payment_ to Emergency Department Physicians
(as defined above).

**[Commentary:**
**1.** First patient seen and additional person seen premiums for Emergency Department
Physicians are eligible for payment only when the physician is required to travel, as defined
under “Travel Premium” page GP66, to make a special visit to the hospital emergency
department.


**February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)** **GP67**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**
**SPECIAL** **VISIT** **PREMIUMS**

**2.** If the Emergency Department Physician is at the hospital at the time the emergency
department request for attendance is made, the appropriate H prefix code may be eligible for
payment.
**3.** If the Emergency Department Physician is called to a hospital ward on a non-elective basis,
the General Listings ("A" prefix) apply and "C" prefix first person seen/additional person seen
special visit premium may be eligible for payment.]

**Note:**
When special visits are rendered by physicians when they are not on duty to the emergency
department, the limits for special visit premiums under the heading "Emergency Department"
(Table I) apply (GP70). For patients assessed during this visit to the emergency department
beyond the defined limits, submit claims for all subsequent patients using the "H" prefix listings.


**GP68** **February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**SPECIAL** **VISIT** **PREMIUMS**


**Medical** **record** **requirements:**
Special Visit Premiums are _only eligible for payment_ if the following requirements are met:

**1.** For fee codes listed in Tables I, II, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X the time at which the special visit
takes place must be documented on the medical record.

**2.** For fee codes listed in Table V;

**a.** the time of the request to attend in the emergency department must be documented on the
medical record; and

**b.** The specific situation requiring the physician's attendance must be documented on the
medical record.


**[Commentary:**
When a special visit service occurs in a hospital, emergency department or long-term care
institution where common medical records are maintained, the time when the visit takes place
may be documented anywhere in the common medical record.]

**Claims** **submission** **instructions:**
Submit claims using the appropriate A-prefix assessment fee from the “General Listings” for an
assessment rendered in conjunction with a special visit premium.

**SUPERVISION** **OF** **POSTGRADUATE** **MEDICAL** **TRAINEES**

**[Commentary:**
**1.** A physician who supervises a medical trainee who renders an insured service is eligible to
be paid for the insured service as if the supervising physician performed the service
personally, subject to any terms, conditions and limitations found in this section.
**2.** The sole purpose of the terms and conditions described in this section is to define when a
service is payable by _OHIP_ . These terms and conditions do not alter the College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario Professional Responsibilities in Postgraduate Medical
Education requirements or any requirements of the institutions responsible for postgraduate
medical education.]
**Note:**
Unless otherwise specified in this section, all other payment requirements in the _Schedule_
related to any service that is performed by a Medical Trainee are applicable.
**DEFINITIONS:**
For the purposes of this section of the _Schedule_ only, the following Definitions apply:

**Supervision:** Supervision is performed by the Supervising Physician and includes the
responsibility to guide, observe and assess the educational activities of
the Medical Trainee and assures the quality of an insured service while
being rendered by the Medical Trainee.

Supervision is only performed:

**a.** in person, by telephone, or videoconference, the method being consistent with the acuity of
the service being rendered by the Medical Trainee as well as the Medical Trainee’s level of
competence;

**b.** when the service is provided within a setting approved by the educational institution where
the Medical Trainee is registered; and

**c.** when the service is within the scope and oversight of the postgraduate medical training
program in which the Medical Trainee is registered.

**[Commentary:**
The Supervising Physician and the Medical Trainee must be physically present in Ontario.]



**Supervising**
**Physician**



The Supervising Physician is a physician who performs Supervision of a
Medical Trainee who renders an insured service to an insured person.
The Supervising Physician must hold an academic appointment with the
educational institution where the Medical Trainee is registered. The
Supervising Physician of a Medical Trainee involved in the care of a
patient may or may not be the most responsible physician for that
patient.



**Medical** **Trainee** A Medical Trainee is a physician who is registered in a postgraduate
training program as a Resident or Clinical Fellow at the time he/she
performs an insured service.

**Resident** A Resident is registered in an accredited postgraduate training program
that leads to certification for practice in Canada as a specialist or
subspecialist by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of
Canada or to certification by the College of Family Physicians of Canada
for practice in Canada as a family physician.


**February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)** **GP79**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**SUPERVISION** **OF** **POSTGRADUATE** **MEDICAL** **TRAINEES**

**Clinical** **Fellow** A Clinical Fellow is registered with a postgraduate training program that
is approved by a university postgraduate medical education office in
Ontario. The Clinical Fellow must have a Certificate of Registration with
the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.

**[Commentary:**
An undergraduate is not a physician and does not meet the definition of a Medical Trainee]


**Procedure** A Procedure is an insured service that has anaesthesia base units listed
in the column headed with “Anae” and includes anaesthesia services
provided by Anaesthesiologists.

**Non-Procedure** A Non-Procedure Service is an insured service, other than Procedures
and Time-Based Services.



**Time-Based**
**Services**



A Time-Based Service is an insured service described as
Psychotherapy, Psychiatric and Counselling, Interviews, Hypnotherapy,
Psychiatric Care and Primary Mental Health Care.


**GP80** **February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**

**SUPERVISION** **OF** **POSTGRADUATE** **MEDICAL** **TRAINEES**
**Payment** **Rules**

**A.** **GENERAL**

**1.** A service rendered by a Medical Trainee is _only eligible for payment_ to the Supervising
Physician where Supervision is provided as defined above and subject to the specific
requirements below.

**2.** Where a Resident with an _OHIP_ billing number is providing insured services independently and
outside their training program, the insured service is _not eligible for payment_ to a Supervising
Physician as there is no Supervision provided.

**[Commentary:**
In the scenario described above the Resident is not performing the service as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Resident would bill _OHIP_ for the service provided.]
**3.** Where a Clinical Fellow with an _OHIP_ billing number is providing insured services
independently and outside their training program, the insured service is _not eligible for payment_
to a Supervising Physician as there is no Supervision provided.

**[Commentary:**
In the scenario described above the Clinical Fellow is not performing the services as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Clinical Fellow would bill _OHIP_ for the services provided. For
example, an orthopedic surgeon may be enrolled in a sarcoma surgery clinical fellowship but
has privileges as a general orthopedic surgeon and may perform, and be eligible for payment,
for rendering a service such as an open reduction of a fracture that is not being supervised by
a Supervising Physician.]
**4.** Special Visit premiums are _not eligible for payment_ to the Supervising Physician unless the
Supervising Physician personally satisfies the payment requirements for a special visit
premium.

**5.** The following services are _not eligible for payment_ to the Supervising Physician when rendered
by a Medical Trainee:

**a.** Case Conferences;
**b.** Multidisciplinary Cancer Conferences;
**c.** Provider-to-provider services, including:

**i.** Telephone Consultations;
**ii.** E-Consultations; and
**iii.** E-Assessments.
**d.** Virtual Care Services when provided to hospital inpatients or patients in an emergency
department.

**B.** **PROCEDURE** **SERVICES**

**1.** A Procedure rendered by a Resident is _only eligible for payment_ to the Supervising Physician
when the Supervising Physician:

**a.** is aware the Resident will render the service; and

**b.** is physically present in the clinical facility at the time the service is rendered; and

**c.** is immediately available to personally attend the patient when requested by the Resident or
other health care professional.


**February 14, 2025 (effective March 3, 2025)** **GP81**


**GENERAL** **PREAMBLE**
**SUPERVISION** **OF** **POSTGRADUATE** **MEDICAL** **TRAINEES**

**2.** A Procedure rendered by a Clinical Fellow is _only eligible for payment_ to the Supervising
Physician when the Supervising Physician:

**a.** is aware the Clinical Fellow will render the service; and

**b.** is available to personally attend the patient when requested by the Clinical Fellow or other
health care professional in a timely manner consistent with the acuity of the clinical
scenario.

**Note:**
Payment rule 2(b) above is not applicable in circumstances where a Supervising Physician
supervises Procedures rendered by a Clinical Fellow for the purpose of procurement of organs
or tissues to be used in transplantation.
**3.** Where a Procedure is rendered by a Clinical Fellow with an _OHIP_ billing number under the
supervision of a Supervising Physician, the Procedure is eligible for payment to the Clinical
Fellow as a surgical assistant if the Procedure has basic units listed in the column headed with
“Asst”.

**[Commentary:**
**1.** The Supervising Physician should submit a claim as the operating surgeon in this situation
(“A” suffix).
**2.** The Clinical Fellow should submit a claim as the assistant (“B” suffix).]
**C.** **TIME-BASED** **SERVICES**

**1.** A Time-Based Service rendered by a Medical Trainee is _only eligible for payment_ to the
Supervising Physician when the Supervising Physician is aware the Medical Trainee will render
the service.

**2.** The number of time units payable is the time spent by the Medical Trainee providing the service
to the patient subject to limits set out below:

**Note:**
**1.** Any time taken in discussion with the Medical Trainee about the case is _not eligible for_
_payment_ .
**2.** The maximum number of time units payable for a Time-Based service rendered by the
Medical Trainee(s) to an individual patient is two units.
**3.** The maximum number of time units payable for a Time-Based service rendered by the
Medical Trainee(s) to a group of two or more patients is four units.

**[Commentary:**
**1.** Where there is more than one Medical Trainee participating in the rendering of a time-based
service concurrently, only the time units rendered by one Medical Trainee are eligible for
payment to the same Supervising Physician.]

**Note:**
**1.** Maximum number of services rendered concurrently include all services rendered by both
the Medical Trainee(s) and the Supervising Physician.

**2.** With respect to the maximum number of services eligible for payment in Specialized Clinics
located at a Quaternary hospital, the following is applicable:

**a.** The maximums are applicable only for clinics that have been approved by the _MOH_ .
**b.** In the absence of _MOH_ approval, the other maximums pertaining to the type and location
of insured services rendered by the Supervising Physician and Medical Trainee(s) are
applicable.
**3.** The above maximums refer to Time-Based Services rendered to individual patients. In
circumstances where Time-Based Services are rendered to groups of two or more patients,
the group session is considered to be a service provided to one patient.

**[Commentary:**
**1.** If the Supervising Physician is personally performing a Procedure at the same time and is
Supervising one Medical Trainee who is performing a Procedure, this situation describes two
insured services that are payable.
**2.** If the Supervising Physician is personally performing a Procedure and at the same time is
Supervising two Medical Trainees who are both performing Procedures, this situation
describes three services but only two of the three insured services are payable.

**SUPERVISION** **OF** **POSTGRADUATE** **MEDICAL** **TRAINEES**

**3.** If the Supervising Physician is personally rendering a service other than a Procedure (i.e. a
Non-Procedure or a Time-Based Service) and is supervising two Medical Trainees who are
performing Procedures concurrently, this situation describes three services but only two
insured services that are payable.
**4.** If the Supervising Physician is personally rendering a Non-Procedure and is Supervising two
Medical Trainees who are both performing Non-Procedures or Time-Based services at the
same time, this situation describes three insured services that are payable.]
**E.** **Forms**

**1.** An insured service listed in the _Schedule_ that includes the completion of a form is _not eligible for_
_payment_ to a Supervising Physician if rendered by a Medical Trainee unless the form has been
reviewed and signed by the Supervising Physician.

**F.** **Medical** **Record** **Requirements**

**1.** A service is _only eligible for payment_ to the Supervising Physician when the medical record of
the patient(s) identifies the following information at the time of the provision of the service:

**a.** The Supervising Physician;

**b.** The Medical Trainee and level of training;

**c.** The description of the insured service performed by the Medical Trainee;

**d.** Patient consent to the Supervision of services of a Medical Trainee; and

**e.** Where the service rendered is a Time-Based service, the Supervising Physician has at a
minimum, reviewed the nature and outcome of the service and the patient record(s), with the
Medical Trainee.

**2.** In addition to the requirements in 1 above, the Supervising Physician must have:

**a.** signed off on the service rendered by the Medical Trainee in the patient’s medical record; or

**b.** where the Supervising Physician was not immediately available to sign off on the service
rendered by the Medical Trainee, the Medical Trainee has written the date and time a
discussion occurred with the Supervising Physician regarding the provision of the service in
the patient’s medical record.

**[Commentary:**
Each entry into the patient’s medical record does not need to contain all of the above medical
record keeping requirements. However, it must be evident upon review of the entire medical
record that all requirements were met at the time of the provision of the Supervised service.
Supervision of the Medical Trainee by the Supervising Physician must be evident in the
medical record. This _may include_ a physical visit to the patient and/or a chart review and
detailed discussion between the Supervising Physician, the Medical Trainee, and other
member(s) of the health team.
The service date to be used for claims is the date the Medical Trainee rendered the insured
service to the patient.]

**CALCULATION** **OF** **FEE** **PAYABLE:** **BASIC** **UNITS** **AND** **TIME** **UNITS**
Except where “nil” is listed opposite the service in the column headed with “Asst”, the amount payable
for the surgical assistant service is calculated by adding together the number of basic and time units
and multiplying that total by the unit fee.

**Assistant** **Unit** **Fee** **................................................................** **$12.51**

**Basic** **Units:** The number of basic units is the number of units listed opposite the service in the
column headed with “Asst”, except

**a.** where multiple or bilateral surgical procedures are performed during the same anaesthetic,
the number of basic units is that listed in the column headed with “Asst” opposite the service
that describes the major procedure; or

**b.** where no basic unit is listed opposite the service in the column headed with “Asst” and
where “nil” is not listed opposite the service in the column headed with “Asst”, the number of
basic units is that listed opposite the service under the column headed with “Anae”. This
type of service is _only eligible for payment_ upon authorization by a _medical consultant_
following submission of a letter from the surgeon outlining the reason the assistant was
required. Submit claims for this type of service using fee code M400B.

Where “nil” is listed opposite the service in the column headed with “Asst”, the assistant’s service is

**CANCELLED** **SURGERY** **- ANAESTHESIA** **SERVICES**

**Payment** **rules:**

**1.** If an anaesthesiologist examines a patient prior to surgery and the surgery is cancelled prior to
the induction of anaesthesia, the service rendered constitutes a hospital subsequent visit.

**2.** When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled prior to commencement of
surgery, the service constitutes E006C with the actual number of time units added to 6 basic
units for this service.

**[Commentary:**
If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced, the amount payable is calculated by
adding the listed procedural basic units plus time units and multiplying the total by the unit fee.]

**SECOND** **ANAESTHESIOLOGIST**
Unless otherwise specified in the Schedule, when the anaesthetic services of more than one
anaesthesiologist are necessary in the interest of the patient, the service provided by the second
anaesthesiologist constitutes E001C with the actual number of time units (based on the actual time
assisting the first anaesthesiologist) added to 6 basic units.


**REPLACEMENT** **ANAESTHESIOLOGIST**
When one anaesthesiologist starts a procedure and is replaced by another anaesthesiologist (“the
replacement anaesthesiologist”) during a surgical procedure or delivery:

**a.** the amount payable to the first anaesthesiologist is calculated by adding the listed
procedural basic units plus time units for the time the first anaesthesiologist is in attendance;

**b.** except in the case of continuous conduction anaesthesia, the service provided by the
replacement anaesthesiologist constitutes E005C based on the actual number of time units
and 6 basic units.

**Note:**
E005C qualifies for the premiums E400C or E401C only if the case commences after hours
(see GP94).

**[Commentary:**
**1.** Each anaesthesiologist must indicate, as part of the medical record, his/her starting and
finishing times.
**2.** For continuous conduction anaesthesia, the replacement anaesthesiologist submits claims
using the applicable continuous conduction anaesthesia fee code.]

**OBSTETRICS** **–** **CONTINUOUS** **CONDUCTION** **ANAESTHESIA**
P014C, introduction of a catheter for labour analgesia, including the first dose of medication with or
without any combined spinal-epidural injection(s), has a value of 7 basic units.


P016C time units for maintenance of obstetrical epidural anaesthesia are calculated on the basis of 1
unit for each ½ hour of time to a maximum of 12 units.

E100C time units for attendance at delivery are calculated on the basis of 4 base units and 1 unit for
each ¼ hour

**Note:**
E025C is _only eligible for payment_ for an unanticipated transfusion of blood during a surgical
procedure where:
**1.** greater than 70 ml/kg of red blood cells are transfused for a patient with a weight up to 50 kg;
or
**2.** 10 or more units of red blood cells are transfused for a patient with a weight exceeding 50 kg.

**[Commentary:**
**1.** For E010, BMI is calculated by dividing the patient’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of
the patient’s height (in metres).
**2.** E025C is defined by the amount of blood transfused rather than the amount of blood loss.
The volume of blood transfused does not include blood collected from a cell saver,
hemodilution techniques or non-red blood cell components.]

**Payment** **rules:**

**1.** In the description of E022C, E016C, E017C and E020C, reference to ASA level for Physical
Status Classification means the level determined by the anaesthesiologist at the time of the preoperative anaesthesia assessment.

**[Commentary:**
The level determined above does not vary, for example, when complications arise during
surgery.]
**2.** E016C, E017C and E020C are _not eligible for payment_ when anaesthesia is rendered to a brain
dead patient for organ donations.

**3.** Local infiltration or topical anaesthesia used as an anaesthetic for any procedure is _not_
_eligible for payment_ .]
**Note:**
For the purposes of anaesthesia services the following definitions apply:
**1.** Procedural Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients
respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile
stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous
ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
**2.** Deep Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot
be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. The
ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. Patients may require
assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate.
Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
**3.** _General Anaesthesia_ is a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not
arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory
function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway,
and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous
ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function
may be impaired.
**ANAESTHESIA** **ADMINISTERED** **BY** **SAME** **PHYSICIAN** **PERFORMING** **A** **PROCEDURE**

**1.** Except as described in paragraph 2, when a physician administers an anaesthetic, nerve block
and/or other medication prior to, during, immediately after or otherwise in conjunction with a
diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure which the physician performs on the same patient,
the administration of the anaesthetic, nerve block and/or other medication is _not eligible for_
_payment_ .

catheter) or intrapleural block ( _with or without_ catheter) for post-operative pain control (with a
duration of action more than 4 hours) is eligible for payment as G224 when rendered in
conjunction with a procedure which the physician performs on the same patient. With the
exception of a bilateral pudendal block (where only one service is eligible for payment), G224 is
eligible for payment once per region per side where bilateral procedures are performed.

preceding service and should not be separately claimed. This includes reporting results of
related procedures and/or assessments (when professionally appropriate to report without
additional patient assessment) and monitoring the patient’s condition remotely until the next
medically necessary assessment.


For clarity, administrative staff may co-ordinate appointments and organize care in a manner
analogous to in-person encounters without violating this condition. Similarly, medically
necessary follow-up services may be organized by the provider (or by their staff) without
violating the condition. However, a physician-initiated call to “check-in” on a patient would not
be eligible for payment, nor would any telephone calls or Video encounters conducted for
administrative purposes (such as to inform patients of clinic closures or the availability of
remote services).


Furthermore, services are not eligible for payment when initiated by the physician (or the
physician’s staff) without a clear and medically necessary reason for doing so. For example,
the communication of normal lab work, unless medically necessary (in so far as the clinical
management of the patient is altered) should not be billed.


Physician-initiated communication to provide advice or guidance regarding a previously
rendered service is also not separately eligible/ billable. A common example of this would occur
when a patient is provided with a prescription along with instruction to fill it only upon receipt of
a positive test result. The call to inform the patient of the test result is not eligible for payment
as it would be considered a Specific Element of the initial (refer to: item F, GP15, Schedule of
Benefits).

**CONSULTATIONS AND** **VISITS**
**VIRTUAL** **CARE** **SERVICES**


As a general rule, the provider should consider whether the remote encounter would have
occurred in their “in-person” practice. In circumstances where an in-person encounter would
not have taken place, it is unlikely that a claim for a virtual service could be supported.


Consultations, which arise from requests from other providers, would not violate the condition
in so far as the patient would have assented to the referral as part of their discussion with the
referring provider.]
**7.** Virtual Care Services are _not eligible for payment_ unless personally performed by the physician
or rendered in accordance with the payment rules regarding supervision of a Medical Trainee.

**8.** Virtual Care Services are _not eligible for payment_ for services provided to hospital inpatients or
patients in a Long-Term Care institution unless all of the following requirements have been met:

**•** The physician providing the service is not the patient's MRP.

**•** The hospital/Long-Term Care institution does not have a physician on staff and
present in the community with the expertise to render the necessary service, as
documented by the referring physician in the patient’s medical record.

**•** An assessment with a direct physical encounter by the referring physician must
have been completed within 30 days preceding a virtual in-patient _specialist_
consultation to confirm the need for a consultation.
**9.** Services involving a direct physical encounter must be made available by the physician
providing Comprehensive Virtual Care Services, or by the physician’s group, within a clinically
appropriate time-frame, if it becomes apparent during a Virtual Care Service that a service
involving a direct physical encounter is medically necessary, or if at the time of scheduling the
service the patient expresses preference for a service involving a direct physical encounter.

**[Commentary:**
For the purpose of this provision, with respect to _specialist_ and GP Focused Practice
Physicians, a group is defined as: those physicians in the same hospital specialty call rotation,
or who are co-located in shared clinical physical space, and have shared access to the
patient’s medical record. For family and general practice physicians, a group is defined as:
Patient Enrollment Model physicians who are signatory or contracted to the same specific
group contract (i.e., as identified by the same group billing number), or those physicians who
are co-located in a shared clinical physical space and have shared access to the patient’s
medical record].
**10.** If during the course of a Virtual Care Service the modality changes (for example, a Telephone
service transitions into a Video service), only the service performed by the modality that
represents the greater part (more than 50%) of the time spent providing the Virtual Care Service
is payable. For _time-based services_, the combined time of both modalities will be used to
calculate the number of time units eligible for payment.

**11.** For _time-based services_, only time spent in direct communication with the patient or the
_patient’s representative_ in the provision of the insured service will be used to calculate the
number of time units eligible for payment.

**[Commentary:**
Both the patient and physician must be located in Ontario for the services to be insured and
payable under OHIP (see section 37.1 of Regulation 552 under the HIA).]

**DIAGNOSTIC** **ULTRASOUND**

**PREAMBLE**
**SPECIFIC** **ELEMENTS**
Diagnostic Ultrasound procedures are divided into a _professional component_ listed in the columns
headed with a “P”, and a _technical component_ listed in the column headed with an "H". The _technical_
_component_ of the procedures subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is _eligible for payment_ only if the service is:

**a.** rendered at a hospital; or

**b.** rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the _Public Hospitals Act_ .

In addition to the _common elements_, the components of Diagnostic Ultrasound procedures include the
following _specific elements_ .


**For** **Professional** **Component**

**A.** Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate.

**B.** Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable.

**C.** Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.

**D.** Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.

**E.** Providing premises for any aspect of D that is performed at a place other than the place in which
the procedure is performed.

**Note:**
**1.** Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
**2.** If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B
and C, these may be delegated to another physician.
**3.** Where the only component provided is interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure,
the _specific elements_ A and C listed for the _professional component_ are included in the
_specific elements_ of the technical component.

**For** **Technical** **Component** **H**

**A.** Preparing the patient for the procedure.

**B.** Performing the diagnostic procedure(s).

**C.** Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.

**D.** Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.

**E.** Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or _patient’s representative_,
whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.

**F.** Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretative report of the procedure to the
referring provider.

**G.** Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all _specific elements_ of the technical
and _professional component_ s except for the premises for any aspect of D of the _professional_
_component_ that is(are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is performed.

**OTHER** **TERMS** **AND** **DEFINITIONS**

**1.** _Professional and technical component_ s are claimed separately. Claims for the _technical_
_component_ H are submitted using listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for _professional_
_component_ are submitted using listed fee code with suffix C. (e.g. J102C)

**2.** For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the _Health_
_Insurance Act_ are listed under the column P (use suffix C). Costs for the _technical component_ of
these services are only billable under the _Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act,_
_2023_ and are listed in the Schedule of Facility Costs.

**3.** A-Mode - implies a one-dimensional ultrasonic measurement procedure.

**4.** M-Mode - implies a one-dimensional ultrasonic measurement procedure with movement of the
trace to record amplitude and velocity of moving echo-producing structures.

**5.** Scan B-Mode - implies a two-dimensional ultrasonic scanning procedure with a two-dimensional
display. All ultrasound examinations include a permanent record and interpretative report.

**6.** If insured diagnostic ultrasound procedures yield abnormal findings or if they would yield
information which in the opinion of the interpreting physician would be insufficient governed by
the needs of the patient and the requirements of the referring provider or practitioner, the
interpreting physician may add further views and claim for them (if listed).

**7.** All benefits listed apply to unilateral examinations unless otherwise specified. When imaging of
only one anatomical area is requested, comparison ultrasound(s) initiated by the interpreting
physician or facility are _not eligible for payment_ .

**DIAGNOSTIC HEARING TEST**

**A.** Diagnostic hearing tests (DHTs) are identified for payment purposes as either basic or advanced
DHTs.

**B.** Basic DHTs are insured services payable at nil unless:

**1.** the _professional component_ is rendered personally by a physician qualified by appropriate
education or training and experience to perform basic DHTs (qualified physician); and

**2.** the _technical component_ is either rendered by a qualified physician or delegated by a qualified
physician to a person who is either an appropriately qualified employee of the physician or is an
audiologist who is a member of the College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists
of Ontario and employed by a public hospital.

**C.** Advanced DHTs are insured services payable at nil unless:

**1.** the _professional component_ is personally rendered by an otolaryngologist or, for evoked
audiometry, a neurologist or by a non-certified physician with equivalent post-graduate
academic training (appropriate specialist or equivalent); and

**2.** the _technical component_ is personally rendered by an appropriate specialist or equivalent, or
delegated by an appropriate specialist or equivalent to an audiologist who is a member of the
College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists of Ontario and is employed by the
appropriate specialist or equivalent or a public hospital.

**D.** Physicians submitting claims for DHTs shall maintain written records of appropriate qualifications
as indicated above for themselves and those employees to whom they may delegate the _technical_
_component_ . Such records must be made available to the ministry on request. In the absence of
such records, the DHT is an insured service payable at nil.


**[Commentary:**
**1.** Delegated DHT services - To qualify for payment, delegated DHT services must comply with
the requirements for delegation of insured services described in the General Preamble
GP62.
**2.** Interpretation of DHT services - To qualify for payment, the physician who claims the
_professional component_ must personally interpret the DHT and cannot delegate the
interpretation to another person.
**3.** Controlled Acts - Communicating to the individual or his or her personal representative a
diagnosis identifying a disease or disorder as the cause of symptoms of the individual in
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that the individual or his or her personal
representative will rely on the diagnosis, or prescribing a hearing aid for a hearing impaired
person are controlled acts. If a physician interprets a diagnostic hearing test without
communicating the diagnosis to the patient or his or her personal representative, a controlled
_act_ has not occurred.
**4.** Fixed level screening audiometry is not an insured service.
**5.** DHTs at the request of or arranged by third party, e.g. school boards, employers or WSIB etc.
are not insured services. See Appendix A regarding third party service.]

**PREAMBLE** **GP85.**
**FOR** **DEFINITION** **OF** **THE** **ROLES** **OF** **THE** **ANAESTHESIOLOGIST** **- SEE** **GENERAL**
**PREAMBLE** **GP92.**

With the exception of the listings in the “Consultations and Visits” section, all references to surgeon in
this _Schedule_ are references to any physician performing the surgical procedure.

**1.** If the surgeon is required to perform a service(s) not usually associated with the original surgical
procedure, he/she may claim for these on a fee-for-service basis.


If special visits to hospital are required at any time post-operatively, the surgeon may claim the
minimum special visit premiums even if the basic hospital visit fees may not be claimed (under
these circumstances the hospital visits should be claimed on an N/C ($00.00) basis).


The surgical benefit as noted above does not include the major pre-operative visit - i.e. the
consultation or assessment fee which may be claimed when the decision to operate is made
and the operation is _schedule_ d, regardless of the time interval between the major pre-operative
visit and surgery.


The hospital or day care admission assessment (consultation, repeat consultation, general or
specific assessment or re-assessment, partial assessment) may not be claimed by the surgeon
unless it happens to be the major pre-operative visit as defined above.


Routine subsequent hospital visits may be claimed for visits rendered more than two days prior
to surgery. Other visits (excluding admission assessments) prior to admission may be claimed
for in addition to the surgical fee.


Because the number of hospital visits is limited to three per _week_ after the fifth _week_ of
hospitalization and six per _month_ after the thirteenth _week_ of hospitalization, the starting point
for calculating the number of hospital visits is based on the date of admission if the operating
surgeon has admitted the patient or the date of _referral_ if the patient has been referred to the
operating surgeon while in hospital.


The listed benefit for a procedure normally includes repair of any iatrogenic complications
occurring during the course of the surgery performed by the same surgeon. Other major
interventions should be handled on an individual basis. The surgical benefit includes the
generally accepted surgical components of the procedure.

**2.** When a physician makes a special visit to perform a non-elective surgical procedure, he/she
may claim the following benefits for procedures commencing:

**a.** 07:00h -17:00h - Monday to Friday
A consultation (if the case is referred) or the appropriate assessment, the appropriate
special visit premium plus the procedural benefit.

**b.** 17:00h - 07:00h - Any night or on Saturdays/Sundays or _Holiday_ s
A consultation or assessment, the appropriate special visit premium, the procedural benefit
plus the surgical premium E409 or E410.

(see General Preamble GP65 to GP78 and GP104).

**SURGICAL** **PREAMBLE**
**PREAMBLE**

**3.** When more than one procedure is carried out by a surgeon under the same anaesthesia or
within 14 days during the same hospitalization for the same condition, the full benefit applies to
the major procedure and 85% of the listed benefit(s) applies to the other procedure(s)
performed unless otherwise stated in the Preamble(s) or _Schedule_ . The above statement
applies to staged or bilateral procedures but does not apply when a normal appendix or simple
ovarian or para-ovarian cyst is removed incidentally during an operation, for which no claim
should be made.

**4.** When a subsequent operation becomes necessary for the same condition because of a
complication or for a new condition, the full benefit should apply for each procedure.

**5.** When a subsequent non-elective procedure is done for a new condition by the same surgeon,
the full benefit will apply to each procedure. When a subsequent elective procedure is done for
a different condition within 14 days during the same hospitalization by the same surgeon, the
benefit for the lesser procedure shall be reduced by 15%.

**6.** When different operative procedures are done by two different surgeons under the same
anaesthesia for different conditions, the benefit will be 100% of the listed benefit for each
condition. Under these circumstances, the basic assistant’s benefit should not be claimed by
either operating surgeon; however time units may be claimed.

**7.** As a general rule, when elective bilateral procedures are performed by two surgeons at the
same time, one surgeon should claim for the surgical procedures and the other surgeon should
claim the assistant’s benefit.

**8.** Where two surgeons are working together in surgery in which neither a team fee nor other
method of billing is set out in the benefit _schedule_, the surgeon should identify him/herself as
the operating surgeon and claim accordingly; the surgeon who is assisting the operating
surgeon should identify him/herself as such and claim the assistant’s benefit.


Where the second or assistant surgeon is brought into the case on a consultation basis, he/she
may, when indicated, claim a consultation as well but should be prepared to justify it on an IC
basis.


Except where otherwise provided in this _Schedule_, if the nature or complexity of a procedure
requires more than one operating surgeon, each providing a separate service in his/her own
specialized field, e.g. one surgeon carries out the ablative part and another surgeon the
reconstructive part of the procedure, then each surgeon should claim the listed benefit for his/
her services. This statement applies when the additional procedure(s) are not the usual
components of the main procedure. If one surgeon, in addition to performing a specialized
portion of a procedure, acts as an assistant during the remainder of the procedure, he/she may
also claim time units for assisting.


When surgical procedures are rendered to trauma patients who have an Injury Severity Score
(ISS) of greater than 15 for individuals age 16 or more, or an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of
greater than 12 for individuals less than age 16, and it is required that two surgeons perform
components of the same procedure, the full surgical fee for that procedure is payable to each
surgeon.

**[Commentary:**
The full surgical fee is payable to each surgeon for surgical procedures rendered either on the
day of the trauma or within 24 hours of the trauma.]

**SURGICAL** **PREAMBLE**

**PREAMBLE**

**9.** Unless otherwise stated, the listed benefits are for unilateral procedures only.

**10.** When a procedure is performed, a procedural benefit, if listed, should be claimed. Substitution
of consultation and/or visit benefits for procedural benefits (except as in paragraph 11), is not in
keeping with the intent of the benefit _schedule_ .

**11.** When a surgical benefit (non- _IOP_, Complete Care, Fracture or Dislocation) is less than the
surgical consultation benefit, and the case is referred, a physician may claim a surgical
consultation benefit instead of the surgical benefit. However, to avoid the consultation being
counted as such under the Ministry of Health limitation rules on the number of consultations
allowed per year, the physician should claim the consultation fee under the surgical procedure
nomenclature or code. Since the consultation is replacing a procedural benefit which includes
the pre- and post-operative and surgical care, no additional claims beyond the consultation
should be made.

**12.** If a physician performs a minor surgical procedure and during the same visit assesses and
treats the patient for another completely unrelated and significant problem involving another
body system, the physician should claim for the procedure as well as the appropriate
assessment.

**13.** Where a procedure is listed with a “Z” code, the procedure is an “ _Independent Operative_
_Procedure_ ( _IOP_ )”. If the major pre-operative visit is rendered in the previous _12-month period_
prior to the _IOP_ service by the same physician, only the following assessment services are
eligible for payment on the same day prior to the _IOP_ service:

**a.** a minor assessment if rendered by a General and Family Physician; or

**b.** a partial assessment if rendered by a _specialist_ .

When the major preoperative assessment is rendered on the same day as the _IOP_, no other
consultation or assessment is eligible for payment if rendered prior to the _IOP_ service by the
same physician on the same day.

When multiple or bilateral _IOP_ are performed at the same time by the same physician, the
listed procedural benefits should be claimed in full but the pre- and post-operative benefits
should be claimed as if only one procedure had been performed.

When an _IOP_ service is rendered on the same day as a non- _IOP_ service by the same
physician, the terms and conditions for payment as described in the ‘Surgical Services which
are not listed as a "Z" code’ section of this _Schedule_ are also applicable to the _IOP_ service(s).
**14.** When procedures are specifically listed under Surgical Procedures, surgeons should use these
listings rather than applying one of the plastic surgery listed fees under Skin and Subcutaneous
Tissue in the Integumentary System Surgical Procedures section of this _Schedule_ .

**15.** For excision of tumours not specifically listed in this _Schedule_, claims should be made on an IC
basis (code R993). Independent Consideration also will be given (under code R990) to claims
for other unusual but generally accepted surgical procedures which are not listed specifically in
the _Schedule_ (excluding non-major variations of listed procedures). In submitting claims,
physicians should relate the service rendered to comparable listed procedures in terms of
scope and difficulty (see General Preamble GP12).

**16.Cosmetic** **or** **esthetic** **surgery:** means a service to enhance appearance without being
medically necessary. These services are not insured benefits (see Appendix D.)

**17.Reconstructive** **surgery:** is surgery to improve appearance and/or function to any area altered
by disease, trauma or congenital deformity. Although surgery solely to restore appearance may
be included in this definition under certain limited conditions, emotional, psychological or
psychiatric grounds normally are not considered sufficient additional reason for coverage of
such surgery. Appendix D of this _Schedule_ describes the conditions under which surgery for
alteration of appearance only may be a benefit. Physicians should submit requests to their
regional _OHIP_ Office for authorization of any proposed surgery which may fall outside of
Ministry of Health coverage. (See Appendix D.)

**18.** Additional claims for biopsies performed when a surgeon is operating in the abdominal or
thoracic cavity will be given Independent Consideration.

**19.** When a listed procedure is performed and no anaesthetic is required, the procedure should be
claimed under the “local anaesthetic” listing.

**20.** Except as described in the paragraph below, when a physician administers an anaesthetic,
nerve block and/or other medication prior to, during, immediately after or otherwise in
conjunction with a diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure which the physician performs
on the same patient, the administration of the anaesthetic, nerve block and/or other medication
is _not eligible for payment_ .


A major or minor peripheral nerve block, major plexus block, neuraxial injection ( _with or without_
catheter) or intrapleural block ( _with or without_ catheter) for post-operative pain control (with a
duration of action more than 4 hours) is eligible for payment as G224 when rendered in
conjunction with a procedure which the physician performs on the same patient.

**[Commentary:**
For additional information, refer to the Nerve Blocks - Acute Pain Management, Nerve Blocks Interventional Pain Injections or Nerve Blocks - Peripheral/Other sections of the _Schedule_ .]
**21.** If claims are being submitted in coded form, the surgeon should add the suffix A to the listed
procedural code, the surgical assistant should add the suffix B to the listed procedural code and
the anaesthetist should add the suffix C to the listed procedural code.

**22.** When Z222/Z223 is claimed for a patient for whom the physician submits a claim for rendering
another insured service on the same day, the amount payable for Z222/Z223 is reduced to nil.

**23.** When a surgical procedure is attempted laparoscopically in the digestive system or the female
genital system, but requires conversion to a laparotomy, unless otherwise specified, the
diagnostic laparoscopic fee E860 is payable in addition to the procedural fee.

E676 is eligible for payment once per patient per physician in addition to the amount eligible for
payment for the major surgical procedure(s) where a morbidly obese patient undergoes major
surgery to the neck, thorax, peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneum, pelvis, or hip and:

**a.** the patient has a _Body Mass Index (BMI)_ greater than 40 for major surgery on the thorax,
peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneum, pelvis, or hip, or a BMI greater than 45 for major surgery
on the neck;

**b.** the surgery is rendered under _general anaesthesia_ using either an open technique for the
neck, thorax, or hip, or an open or laparoscopic technique for the peritoneal cavity, pelvis,
retroperitoneum; and

**c.** the principal surgical technique is neither aspiration, core or fine needle biopsy, dilation,
endoscopy, mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, cautery, ablation nor catheterization.

E673 is payable to the surgeon in addition to the fee for the major intra-abdominal procedure
only when lysis requires at least 60 minutes beyond the average duration of the major
procedure. E673 less than 60 minutes in duration or rendered in conjunction with E718 is an

**27.Cancelled** **surgery** **–** **surgical** **services**

**a.** If the procedure is cancelled prior to induction of anaesthesia, the service constitutes a
subsequent hospital visit.

**b.** When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled due to a complication prior to
commencement of surgery and the surgeon has scrubbed but is not required to do anything
further, the service constitutes E006A and the amount payable is calculated by adding the
time units to 6 basic units and multiplying by the surgical assistant’s unit fee.

**c.** If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced but prior to its completion, the
service is _eligible for payment_ under independent consideration (R990).

**[Commentary:**
Submit claim for R990 by adding the time units to the listed procedural basic units and
multiplying by the surgical assistant’s unit fee and attach a copy of the operative report for
review by a _medical consultant_ .]

**Note:**
For the purpose of cancelled surgery, time units for the surgeon are calculated in the same way

Mohs micrographic surgery is eligible for payment when rendered for a lesion that is a
histologically confirmed cutaneous malignancy (including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma, malignant melanoma, lentigo maligna, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,
sebaceous carcinoma, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, Merkel cell
carcinoma, eccrine carcinoma, extramammary Paget's disease, leiomyosarcoma and primary
cutaneous adenocarcinoma); and that meets one or more of the following conditions:
**a.** a lesion with clinical margins greater than 1.5 cm;

**b.** a lesion located in an anatomically sensitive area, in particular but not limited to the
periocular, perinasal, perilabial, and periauricular surfaces, or the nose;

**c.** a recurrent malignancy that has not responded to prior therapy;

**d.** a malignant lesion in a patient with immunodeficiency or genodermatoses predisposing to
widespread skin cancers, such as basal cell nevus syndrome;

**e.** a histologically aggressive lesion (such as a basal cell carcinoma that is sclerosing,
infiltrative, baso-squamous, or micronodular, or a squamous cell carcinoma that is poorly
differentiated, or demonstrates peri-neural/lymphatic/vascular involvement) at any anatomic
site.

**Note:**
**1.** R081 and E524 are eligible for payment only to physicians with generally accepted
specialized training in Mohs surgery.

**[Commentary:**
An example of generally accepted specialized training is the successful completion of a
fellowship accredited by the American College of Mohs Surgery.]

**1.** R081 is eligible for payment only when the preparation of slides is rendered or supervised by
the physician claiming R081 and all microscopic tissue sections are personally reviewed and
interpreted by the physician claiming R081. If a pathologist interprets or submits a claim for
analyzing histological slides prepared by the physician claiming R081, R081 and E524 are
_not eligible for payment_ .

**[Commentary:**
In these circumstances, the physician should instead claim the appropriate fee code for
excising a malignant skin lesion.]
**2.** Closure of the resulting defect by undermining and advancement flaps is included in the
above fees. If more complicated closure is necessary, the service may be eligible for
payment using fee codes under skin flaps and grafts.
**Payment** **rules:**
**1.** R081 is eligible for payment once per lesion including when excision of the lesion is
completed over two or more days up to two _week_ s.

**[Commentary:**
The setting of benefits covering the various procedures of plastic surgery is a very difficult
problem. Since many procedures are divided into stages which have to be considered in
assessing a fee, it is felt that all such plastic surgical procedures should be classed by the
responsible _specialist_ as very minor, intermediate, major or extensive major. Benefits should be
claimed according to procedures set forth in the tariff, except in cases which are difficult to
define, in which case “I.C” should be the basis of the claim.]

The minimum benefit for each would be as follows:
# R150 Very minor............................................................................... 92.30 6
# R151 Minor....................................................................................... 6 140.25 6
# R152 Intermediate............................................................................ 6 259.20 7

**A.** Corrective splints must be corrective to qualify for a benefit as such. The corrective splint listings
are not applicable to simple immobilization such as with a Jones bandage or metal finger splint
following soft tissue injury.

**B.** The removal of a wire or pin or other device when used for traction or external fixation (except for
rigid external fixators) in the treatment of a fracture or other orthopaedic procedure is to be included
in the procedural fee (unless otherwise stated in the _Schedule_ ) unless a general anaesthetic is
required, in which case a fee may be claimed. Removal of devices used for internal fixation more
than 30 days after insertion may be claimed for in addition to the procedural benefit.

**C.** The benefit for total joint replacement also includes denervation of the joint, all tenotomies and
division and repair of muscle.

**D.** The benefit for obtaining a bone graft is not to be claimed in cases of pseudoarthrosis repair,
fusions or for listings in which bone grafting is included.

**E.** For the supervision of limb fitting and 6 _month_ s post-operative care following amputation, claim visit
fees. Amputation with immediate fitting to include supervision of final limb fitting, add 40% (E586).

**Note:**
Reconstruction or Arthroplasty Procedures: If other procedures are claimed, same joint, same
time, e.g. debridement, synovectomy, tendon release etc., the _Medical Consultant_ will assess
the surgeon's claim.

**FRACTURES** **AND** **DISLOCATIONS**

**1.** For fractures or dislocations requiring open or closed reduction or no reduction, the major preoperative visit, i.e. consultation or appropriate assessment, may be claimed in addition to the
listed benefits.

**2.** **OPEN** **REDUCTION** shall mean the treatment of a fracture and/or dislocation by either closed
intramedullary fixation or by an operative procedure to expose the fracture. The benefits include
fixation by internal or external devices.

**3.** **CLOSED** **REDUCTION** shall mean the reduction of a fracture or dislocation by non-operative
methods (including traction).

**4.** **NO** **REDUCTION** shall mean the treatment of a fracture or dislocation by any other method and
includes the use of the initial external support other than a simple splint. No reduction, rigid
immobilization, means that the device used to achieve a rigid immobilization is custom-molded
and is applied by the physician. In cases involving no reduction, application of a simple splint,
such as a metal splint, is not billable as rigid immobilization (visit fees only apply).

**PREAMBLE**

**5.** The service includes all related follow-up treatment by the physician for 2 _week_ s from the date
of treatment of the fracture or dislocation except:

**a.** for the first and second post-treatment visits to a hospital in-patient;

**b.** for the subsequent visit by the _MRP_   - day of discharge (C124);

**c.** for the first post-treatment visit when the patient is no longer a hospital in-patient;

**d.** if additional reductions are necessary;

**e.** if the patient is transferred to another surgeon; or

**f.** if the patient is a paraplegic.

**[Commentary:**
The first and second post-treatment visits in hospital for 2 _week_ s from the date of treatment of
the fracture or dislocation are payable at the specialty specific subsequent visit fee.]
**6.** In multiple fractures or dislocations, the benefit for the major fracture or dislocation shall be
100% and the benefit for the other fractures or dislocations is 85%. When no procedural benefit
is applicable, but that fracture or dislocation necessitates hospitalization or concurrent care over
that demanded by the major injury, a visit benefit may be claimed in addition to other procedural
benefits.

**7.** For repeat reductions (closed or open) for the same fracture or dislocation, the full benefit
should be claimed for the final reduction and after care; previous reductions by the same
surgeon should be claimed at 85%.

**8.** Emergency splinting of fractures in the emergency department should be on the basis of
appropriate visit benefit, plus application of cast if appropriate.

**9.** Transferred cases:

**a.** When patients are transferred to a chronic or convalescent facility, additional visit benefits on
a chronic care basis shall be allowed to other than the operating surgeon (and also to the
surgeon after 2 _week_ s).

**b.** When patients are transferred to another physician for after care of fractures and
dislocations treated by closed or no reduction, the physician rendering the initial care should
claim 75% of the listed fee and the surgeon rendering subsequent care should claim visit
fees except where otherwise specified. In cases involving open reduction, the percentage
should be 80% for the surgeon providing the initial care.

**c.** In cases where the original physician's attempts to reduce a fracture or dislocation under
_general anaesthesia_ is unsuccessful, and the patient is referred to another physician for
definitive care, the original physician should claim 75% of the listed fee.

**10.** Pseudoarthrosis repair/reconstruction is only payable when a fracture requires additional
reconstruction because of inadequate healing at least 4 _months_ following the original injury.
Pseudoarthrosis repair/reconstruction includes bone graft, debridement, osteotomy and internal
or external fixation other than the use of an intramedullary nail with distal and proximal locking
screws, or circular external fixation if performed.

**11.** For fractures and dislocations not requiring reduction, visit fees apply unless a specific fee is
listed. If the listed fee is less than the consultation, the consultation should be claimed under the
fracture/dislocation fee code number.

**Combined** **Abdominal-Vaginal** **Procedure** **for** **Stress** **Incontinence** **(Sling** **Procedure)**

**[Commentary:**
Combined abdominal vaginal sling procedures are indicated for the management of stress
incontinence or genital prolapse, particularly following previous failed anti-incontinence
procedures of any kind, or a very large cystocoele. The procedure usually entails entry into the
space of Retzius through an abdominal approach (open or laparoscopic) in conjunction with an
anterior vaginal dissection ( _with or without_ cystoscopy) following which the sling material
(autologous, synthetic or xenograft) is passed through the perineal membrane, placed under
appropriate tension at the bladder neck, and sutured to Cooper’s ligament bilaterally.]

**Payment** **rules:**
**1.** Anti-prolapse procedures or other anti-incontinence procedures are _not eligible for payment_
when rendered with combined abdominal-vaginal procedures for stress incontinence (sling
procedures).

**2.** Cystoscopy (Z606) is _not eligible for payment_ with combined abdominal-vaginal procedures
for stress incontinence (sling procedures) unless the cystoscopy is rendered for suspicion of
disease.

**[Commentary:**
Those procedures listed under the titles “Following one previous failed procedure” or “Following
two or more previously failed procedures” are eligible for payment following failure of the
appropriate number of any listed procedure.]

**APPENDIX D**

**PREAMBLE**

**1.** Surgery to alleviate significant physical symptoms, which have not responded to a minimum of
six _month_ s active treatment, or to restore or improve function to any area altered by disease,
trauma or congenital deformity normally is an insured service.

**2.** Services rendered by physicians that are solely for the purpose of alteration or restoration of
appearance are not an insured service except under circumstances as listed in the following
policy:

**a.** Emotional, psychological or psychiatric grounds are not considered sufficient reason for the
coverage of surgery for alteration of appearance except under exceptional circumstances.

**b.** Surgery to alter a non-symptomatic significant defect in appearance caused by disease,
trauma, or congenital deformity may be allowed on an Independent Consideration basis, on
request of the operating physician provided that it is

**i.** Recommended by a Mental Health Facility (as designated by The _Mental Hospitals Act_ )
or equivalent, or

**ii.** Performed on a patient who is less than 18 years of age and the defect is in the area of
the body which normally and usually would not be clothed.

**3.** In establishing this policy, it has been recognized that

**a.** Peer acceptance in our society often is influenced disproportionately by facial appearance.

**b.** _Child_ ren are especially susceptible to emotional trauma caused by physical appearances.

**4.** Surgery to revise or remove features of physical appearance which are familial in nature and do
not interfere with function is not an insured service.

**5.** Within the context of this policy, the word “disease” does not include the normal sequelae of
aging. Surgery to alter changes in appearances caused by aging is not an insured service.

**6.** Within the context of this policy, the word “trauma” includes trauma due to treatment such as
surgery, radiation, etc.

**7.** The phrase “reasonable period of convalescence” should be considered as two years.
Independent consideration will be given to the questionable cases.

**8.** Prior authorization from the Ministry of Health is not required for all surgery to alter appearance.
It is required only for those categories of procedures in which some cases may not be an
insured service.

**9.** Suitable documentation, with the exception of photographs, may be requested in some cases
before prior authorization can be considered.

**10.** The treatment of acute medical or surgical complications resulting from surgery for alteration of
appearance and/or function is an insured service whether or not the original surgery was
covered by the Ministry of Health. No prior authorization is required.

**11.** Revision, because of undesirable results, of a surgery, which was originally performed for
alteration of appearance, is an insured service only if the original surgery was an insured
service and if the revision either is part of a pre-planned staged process or occurs within a
reasonable period of convalescence. Prior authorization is required only when the original
surgical procedure, if it had been carried out at the time of the proposed revision, would have
required such authorization.

**APPENDIX D**

**SURFACE** **PATHOLOGY**

**1. Trauma** **Scars**

**a.** Neck or Face:

**i.** Includes ears and non-hair bearing areas of the scalp.
